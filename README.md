How does EliteContributions work?
EliteContributions aims to streamline the contribution process, making it easy and rewarding for developers. Here's how it works:

Fork the Repository: Start by forking the EliteContributions repository to your GitHub account. This creates a copy of the repository under your account.

Choose an Issue: Browse through the repository's issues to find one that piques your interest. Each issue represents a specific contribution opportunity.

Make your Contribution: Create a new branch in your forked repository, and make the necessary changes to address the issue. This could involve fixing a bug, adding a feature, improving documentation, or anything else that aligns with the issue's description.

Submit a Pull Request (PR): Once you have made your changes, submit a PR to the main EliteContributions repository. The project maintainers will review your PR and provide feedback if needed. They will assess the quality and relevance of your contribution.

Earn your Swags: If your PR is approved and merged into the main repository, congratulations! You have successfully contributed to Hacktoberfest 2022 through EliteContributions. As a token of appreciation, you will earn swags, which could include t-shirts, stickers, or other goodies.
